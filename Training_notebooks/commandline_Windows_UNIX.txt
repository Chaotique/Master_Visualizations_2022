In class, you were asked to solve the following task in the command line: 

1. Create a new folder "learn_bash".
2. Create a file "hello.txt" and a folder "texts", both inside "learn_bash".
3. Move "hello.txt" into "texts".

# In UNIX that would be:
mkdir learn_bash
cd learn_bash
touch hello.txt
mkdir texts
mv hello.txt texts

# In Windows, all is the same, but the touch command does not exist, so you would do:
mkdir learn_bash
cd learn_bash
echo somethingyouwanttowriteintothefile > hello.txt
mkdir texts
mv hello.txt texts


# To check which files are in your current folder, type:
#in UNIX: 
ls
# in Windows:
dir


# To move one folder up, type:
cd ..
# To move to the HOME folder:
cd ~
# Note that you don't have to write the entire names of files/ folders. Just type the first couple of leters (case-sensitive!) and use TAB to complete. 

# Use up and down arrows to move to commands you used before. Use Ctrl+R to search a specific command in your command history.
